These reports are generated by Netwrix using integrated data from SentinelOne. They provide visibility into endpoint security threats, response actions, and device behavior through structured visual reporting.

------------------------------------------------------------

1. Threat Detection Summary
Description:
  Provides a consolidated overview of all threats reported by SentinelOne across managed endpoints. 
  The report includes threat names, types (e.g., malware, ransomware, exploit), affected devices, severity scores, and detection timestamps. 
  It helps security teams visualize the breadth of threats over a specific period.

Widgets Used:
  - Threats Summary Table: Tabular view listing threat name, threat type, severity, affected device, and detection time.
  - Threat Severity Heatmap: Visual heatmap showing intensity of threats across devices or time periods.
  - Top Threat Types Pie Chart: Pie chart breaking down detected threats by classification.
  - Detection Timeline Graph: Chronological line or bar chart representing how threats evolved over time.

------------------------------------------------------------

2. Endpoint Incident Report
Description:
  A detailed incident-level report generated per endpoint device where a threat was detected. 
  The report includes execution paths, parent/child processes, command-line arguments, and attacker behavior patterns.
  MITRE ATT&CK tactics (if available) are mapped to provide context on adversary techniques.

Widgets Used:
  - Device-Level Incident Table: Table showing incidents per device, with threat description, category, and status.
  - MITRE Tactic Matrix Mapping: Graphical view mapping observed behavior to MITRE techniques and tactics.
  - Remediation Status Tracker: Displays the current state (resolved, active, in progress) of incidents.
  - Isolation Status Panel: Shows whether the endpoint was isolated by SentinelOne response.

------------------------------------------------------------

3. Active Threats Report
Description:
  Displays a real-time or recent snapshot of active (unresolved) threats detected by SentinelOne.
  Helps in identifying ongoing infections or systems needing remediation attention.
  Highlights threat severity, type, and impacted device.

Widgets Used:
  - Active Threats Table: A real-time table view of unresolved threats.
  - Threat Status Donut Chart: Visual donut showing percentage of threats by current state (active, resolved, quarantined).
  - Risk Score Filter Panel: Allows filtering of threats based on SentinelOne’s assigned risk or confidence score.

------------------------------------------------------------

4. Threat Timeline Analysis
Description:
  Offers a chronological breakdown of each threat’s lifecycle—from detection to resolution.
  Enables analysis of detection speed, containment delay, and remediation actions taken.
  Useful for measuring incident response effectiveness.

Widgets Used:
  - Detection → Response Timeline Chart: Visual graph showing timestamps for each stage in the threat lifecycle.
  - Process Lineage Viewer: Shows the process tree starting from the initial infection vector.
  - Remediation Delay Graph: Highlights time gaps between detection and response actions (kill/quarantine/rollback).

------------------------------------------------------------

5. High-Risk Device Summary
Description:
  Focuses on endpoints that have encountered multiple threats, high-severity detections, or show patterns of recurring compromise.
  Helps security teams identify vulnerable assets for patching, further investigation, or isolation.

Widgets Used:
  - Top Devices by Threat Count: Bar chart or list showing devices with the highest number of threat events.
  - Risk Score Summary Table: Table detailing SentinelOne’s risk assessment per device.
  - Repeat Offender Bar Graph: Highlights endpoints with recurring infections across different time frames.

------------------------------------------------------------

6. Policy Violation Report
Description:
  Monitors for configuration drift or violations of defined endpoint security policies.
  Tracks blocked applications, outdated agent versions, or other compliance deviations as reported by SentinelOne.

Widgets Used:
  - Violation Summary Table: Lists all policy violations by device, user, and category.
  - Device Attribution Table: Maps violations to associated device and responsible user.
  - Policy Compliance Trend Chart: Time-series chart showing trend of policy violations over days/weeks.

------------------------------------------------------------

7. Automated Response Activity Report
Description:
  Summarizes all automatic or user-triggered remediation actions taken by SentinelOne agents in response to detections.
  Includes rollback events, process kills, quarantines, and isolation events.

Widgets Used:
  - Response Action Count Chart: Bar or pie chart showing counts of each action type (Kill, Quarantine, Rollback, etc.).
  - Response Time Histogram: Shows distribution of time taken to respond to threats.
  - Correlation Table (Device ↔ Threat ↔ Action): Table that links each action with the initiating threat and affected device.
